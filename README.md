# Hipo Labs Frontend Exercise

This project was created for Hipo Labs Frontend Interview.

### Description

In this project, I've created a search form that you can type keyword and select a collection in order to search photos from

You can narrow your results using collection but if you don't choose any collection you will get an more general results.

After searching, you can find photo's detail and you'll see a download button that is provided by Unsplash. Therefore, it's totally fair to download any photo. On top of that, the project is responsive so that you can use it on your mobile device.

Finally, because of time limitations, unfortunately, there is some lack of features such as pagination, Google Map, etc.
